PdfTools v1.0-dev :
===================

**Important : this version is a new build from scratch, it is not usable**

A new approach for a new Tool for reading, editing, saving PDF Files. A whole rebuilt based on current libs widely used.

Why :
-----

I can not stand FPDI, FPDF, HTML2PDF, TCPDF anymore, these libs that are not sufficiently maintained and their authors do not care at all about "keeping up" with php new feature. Old code style make me sick ! A 1MB class file with no isolation, no design pattern correctly placed, untestable...I would rather die that maintain such code myself.

We can not afford to use these libs anymore, php evolve, tools have to evolve too. As php 5.3 support will die soon, this whole new component will be written for php 5.4+ (maybe 5.5+) and bundled as module for common framework.
